/// This file contains hardcoded coordinates for each dining hall,
/// to help you get a head start.
///
/// To use each of these coordinates, you can access the corresponding
/// property on `CLLocationCoordinate2D` like so:
/// ```swift
/// let coords = CLLocationCoordinate2D.commons
/// ```
/// Or, if the Swift compiler can infer the type:
/// ```swift
/// let coords: CLLocationCoordinate2D = .commons
/// ```
///
/// We don't recommend you use this directly in your app's logic - instead,
/// embed them into whatever larger data structure you use to keep track
/// of dining halls as a whole, so you can store them alongside details such
/// as name and current state.
///
/// You can copy and paste this as a file in your project. As always, let
/// us know if you have questions or need help!
